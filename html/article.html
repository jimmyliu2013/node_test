<p>A reader has asked for a discussion of the words, <em>bureaucrats</em> vs <em>officials</em>, and <em>lawmakers</em> vs <em>politicians</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p>[I’d] like to know what teachers and English-language experts think of the use of these terms in the media, politics, or in everyday conversation. For example, why using “bureaucrats” in a sentence will generate a different reaction than using the neutral “officials”?</p></blockquote>
<p>All but the most utilitarian words in English have connotations— shades of meaning that influence the way a statement is understood by readers or listeners. </p>
<p>Sometimes the connotation arises from the word’s denotation. For example, the ordinary current sense of the word <em>coffin</em> is “the box in which a corpse is enclosed.” The connotation of <em>coffin</em> as a gloomy word derives from its denotation as an object associated with death. </p>
<blockquote><p>denotation=what a word means<br>
connotation=what a word suggests</p></blockquote>
<p>The noun <em>mother</em>, on the other hand, denotes “a woman who has given birth to a child.” Because<br>
(it is hoped) most women who have given birth nurture and cherish their children, <em>mother</em> connotes warmth and all-encompassing love. </p>
<p>The word <em>bureaucrat</em>, derived from <em>bureaucracy</em>, acquired its negative connotation at the get-go.</p>
